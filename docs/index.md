# Welcome to belvedere-summer-school

Learning resources from the 10th edition of the Summer School "***Design and Implementation of Topographic Surveys for Territorial Monitoring in Mountain Environments***", organized by the Section of Geodesy and Geomatics of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (DICA), Politecnico di Milano.

## The Summer School

In 2023, the 10th edition of the Summer School, organized by the Section of Geodesy and Geomatics within the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (DICA) at Politecnico di Milano, was curated. The Summer School, titled *"Design and Implementation of Topographic Surveys for Territorial Monitoring in Mountain Environments"*, is aimed at undergraduate and graduate students in Civil and Environmental Engineering, Geoinformatics and Architecture.

The main objective of the Summer School is to provide students with practical experience in the field of **topographic land monitoring in mountain environments**, a crucial topic that is often only taught in theory during classes. In particular, the Summer School focuses on surveying the **Belvedere Glacier**, a temperate debris-covered alpine glacier, located in the Anzasca Valley, municipality of Macugnaga, Italy, to monitor the glacier's annual evolution. The 10th edition of the Summer School took place from July 23rd to July 28th 2023.

The Summer School is part of a long-term monitoring activity of the Belvedere Glacier, where annual in-situ GNSS and UAV photogrammetry surveys have been carried out since 2015 to derive accurate and complete 3D models of the entire glacier, allowing the derivation of glacier velocity and volume variations over the last 10 years (Ioli et al., 2022, https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14010028).

The organising team believes that the integration of the Summer School into an ongoing research project adds value to the experience, as it allows students to work in close contact with young tutors who are passionate about the topic and contribute to the acquisition of data that will be effectively used by researchers. This has been confirmed by the previous editions of the Summer School, held in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, which have already taken place on the Belvedere Glacier.

The program of the Summer School lasts one week and uses the **Zamboni Zappa Refuge** (2070 m. a.s.l.) as the main base for the activities. These begin on Sunday, with the transportation of survey material to the Zamboni Zappa Refuge and a plenary seminar introducing the participants to the Summer School activities. From Monday to Thursday field activities take place on the glacier. These activities include the planning of topographic and photogrammetric surveys with UAV's, measurements with GNSS and laser scanner instruments, and initial data processing. On Friday, students organize the preliminary results that can be derived from the measured data and present their work to a panel of professors and researchers from the DICA department.

The Summer School is part of the [***"Passion in action"***](https://www.polimi.it/en/programmes/innovative-teaching/) initiative organized by Politecnico di Milano. At the end of the experience, students receive a certificate of attendance, and the course is awarded 3 CFUs, which are included in the Diploma Supplement attached to the degree. The organising team expected a minimum of six students for the course and a maximum of twelve students are accepted. In case of over-enrollment, those who have passed an aptitude interview are admitted. In previous editions the Summer School recorded a participation of an average of ten students enrolled (eleven in 2016, twelve in 2017, ten in 2018, eleven in 2019, twelve in 2021 and seven in 2022; in 2022, the Summer School was held a few weeks after the catastrophic collapse of the Marmolada Glacier, which killed eleven people, and this may be related to the number of withdrawals).

On this website, the organising team has created a comprehensive section for teaching material on the basics of **photogrammetry**, **GNSS** and **GIS**, including raster processing basics, planning UAV-photogrammetry acquisitions, and using common Structure-from-Motion software packages such as Agisoft Metashape. This material is published on the research group's website (https://labmgf.dica.polimi.it/projects/belvedere/) and on a dedicated public repository on GitHub, making it accessible to all and ensuring reproducibility for future teaching activities. To achieve this, the MkDocs Python library was chosen to develop a user-friendly website easy to navigate and provide learners with valuable resources to enhance their understanding of photogrammetry and GNSS concepts.

All data collected on Belvedere Glacier, including the **3D models** of the glacier, the **orthophotos**, and the **Digital Surface Models** (DSM), have been published as open data in an existing public repository on Zenodo. The repository is accessible at this link https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7842348.

It is worth mentioning that junior researchers are actively involved in organizing the Summer School. The Summer School is organized and directed by Prof. Livio Pinto (livio.pinto@polimi.it), with the active participation of PhD students Francesco Ioli (francesco.ioli@polimi.it) and Federica Gaspari (federica.gaspari@polimi.it), a temporary research fellow Federico Barbieri as tutors. Additionally, dott. Lorenzo Rossi and prof. Carlo De Gaetani are involved in the Summer School organization and post-processing of the acquired data. The learning resources were also revised by PhD studente Rebecca Fascia.

The team strongly believe that this summer school and its learning material offer a unique opportunity for students to gain practical experience in the field of topographic land monitoring, which is crucial in the current scenario of climate change.
