# Overview

The module 3 of the course is dedicated to **GNSS** theory.

## Learning outcomes

Students will learn the basics of GNSS positioning theory.

Upon completing the GNSS module, students will:

- Understand GNSS systems: Grasp the functioning of major GNSS systems like GPS, GLONASS, and GALILEO, and their global applications.
- Undestand the GNSS observations: Learn essential skills in processing pseudo-range and phase observations, considering error factors.
- Undestrand abosolute and relative positioning approaches: Implement advanced techniques like single and double differences for accurate relative positioning between receivers.
