# Overview

The module 1 of the course is dedicated to the presentation of the monitoring activities of the Belvedere glacier surface. 

## Learning outcomes

The aim of this module is to show students some methods of topographic monitoring applied to a natural environment undergoing profound and rapid transformation, such as the Belvedere glacier. It will also be possible to assess the results that this kind of campaigns can lead to, in terms of quantitative evaluation of the morphological changes occurred.

## Table of contents

1. **[Instrumental techniques](instrumental-techniques.md)**: brief introduction to the main survey techniques: UAV photogrammetry and GNSS.

2. **[Monitoring campaigns](monitoring-campaigns.md)**: this section provides a summary of the techniques and approaches used in the campaigns carried out between 2015 and 2022.

3. **[Monitoring results](monitoring-results.md)**: this page will present the main results obtained from the monitoring. In particular, we will investigate the surface velocity field of the glacier and its volumetric variation.
