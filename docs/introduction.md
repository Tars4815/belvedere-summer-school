## The Belvedere Glacier

The Belvedere Glacier (Randolph Glacier Inventory code RGI60-11.02858) is an alpine glacier in Valle Anzasca (Italy), on the east side of the Monte Rosa Massif (located at approximately 45◦ 58’ N 7◦ 55’ E) (Fig. 1a). The lower part of the Belvedere Glacier is a temperate debris-covered glacier, that covers an area of ∼1.8 km2 and extends from an altitude of ∼2250 m a.s.l. to ∼1800 m a.s.l.
This region is characterized by a gentle slope, and it is fed by ice falls and snow avalanches coming from the Monte Rosa East Face.
It covers an area of ∼1.8 km2 and it is mainly elongated in South-North direction, with a length of ∼3000 m and a maximum width of only ∼500 m. Similarly to Miage glacier (Monte Bianco, Valle d’Aosta), the Belvedere Glacier is almost completely covered by rocks and debris.
In its low-relief sector, the Belvedere Glacier splits into two lobes. The two glacier lobes reach ∼1800 m a.s.l. The northern lobe ends with a prominent ice cliff, from which the River Anza springs.
Except from the terminal ice cliff, the glacier tongue is completely covered by rocks and boulders with dimensions ranging from few decimetres to some meters.

## Glacier Hazards and surge event of 2001-2002
In the past, several hazardous events originated by Belvedere Glacier, such as floods and slope instability, threatened the nearby village of Macugnaga and the Zamboni Zappa Hut, at 2070 m a.s.l. (Kääb et al., 2004). At the beginning of the 21st century, the Belvedere Glacier was characterized by a particular surge-type dynamics (Haeberli et al., 2002): a wave of compression-decompression stresses was generated by an accelerated ice flow derived from the glacier accumulation area. Surface velocities reached up to 200 m y−1 (Kääb et al., 2004) and the ice thickness increased more than 20 m. A more detailed description of the characteristics of the Belvedere Glacier and the glacier-related hazards can be found in previous studies, such as (Haeberli et al., 2002; Ioli et al., 2022; Kääb et al., 2004).
