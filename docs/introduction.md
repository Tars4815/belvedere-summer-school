## The Belvedere Glacier

The Belvedere Glacier is a temperate alpine glacier located on the east face of Monte Rosa, the Anzasca Valley, Italy.

It extends from an altitude of about ∼2250 m a.s.l and reaches its lowest altitude at about 1800 m a.s.l., where it splits in two different glacier tongues (Figure 1).
The Belvedere Glacier covers an area of ∼1.8 km2 and it is mainly elongated in South-North direction, with a length of ∼3000 m and a maximum width of only ∼500 m. Similarly to Miage glacier (Monte Bianco, Valle d’Aosta), the Belvedere Glacier is almost completely covered by rocks and debris.
