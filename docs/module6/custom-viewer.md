# Customise the viewer

Once loaded the point cloud in the Web Viewer as described [here](./web-viewer.md), it is possible to add custom functionalities, enriching the 3D scene with additional entities that could support both environment exploration and project storytelling. In particular, we will see example on how to include:
1. Georeferenced annotations
2. Drone images oriented on the pointcloud

## Inserting annotations

Adding custom annotations is particularly useful if it is needed to highlights particular position of the scene (measurement stations, base camp location) or if it is necessary to integrate actions or media. Indeed, having a simple familiarity with HTML code, it is possible to further customise the description label associated to an annotation.

Generally, in a normal exploration session of the viewer, users can add georeferenced position by simply clicking the annotation icon on the Potree sidebar on the *Tools > Measurement* section.

Once clicked, it is necessary to navigate in the viewer, look for the desired perspective on the scene and then right-click again on the point where you'd like to position the annotation. A black label with the text *Annotation Title* will then be added to the scene. The new element will also be visile in the *Scene > Annotations* section in the sidebar. By clicking on it there, in the *Properties* it will be possible to type the desired Title and Description.
