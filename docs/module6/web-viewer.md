# 3D Viewer implementation

In order to start designing the web page that is going to host the Potree-based viewer, start creating a new folder within *C:\xampp\htdocs*. Name it according to the name you want to associate to the url. For example, if you'll name it *belvedere-example*, when you'll access the test web page you will have to search for *localhost/belvedere-example* on the browser.

The folder you have just created will contain all the files and assets needed to enable the Potree viewer. In particular:

* **index.html**: this file with HTML extension will be the homepage of the 3D web viewer, containing the basic settings for the GUI and including the paths to additional external files for style (css) and/or functionalities (js).

* **libs** folder: it contains many subfolders for all libraries' dependencies for making functionable the viewer.

* **licenses** folder: it includes license specifications for the libraries used in the development.

* **css** folder: it contains file(s) that define the style and appearance of the web page.

* **js** folder: this includes all the scripting JavaScript files that enable native and/or custom functionalities and actions on the web page.

* **pointclouds** folder: inside this space converted pointclouds are saved with their ancillary files.
