# Overview

The module 6 of the course is dedicated to defining a WebGL-based visualisation of 3D georeferenced data using **Potree**.

## Learning outcomes

Through a combination of theoric concepts and hands-on exercise, students will understands the essentials of Geographic Information Systems adoption in the context of environmental studies. Also, learners will get familiar with the manipulation of vector and raster data for quantitative and qualitative analysis with practical applications in a free and open-source GIS environment. Eventually, students will understand how to prepare cartographic output and reports to share the results of their studies.
