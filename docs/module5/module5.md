# Stereoprocessing
# Overview

The module 5 of the course is dedicated to an introduction on the stereo processing from fixed-time-lapse cameras.

## Learning outcomes


## Table of contents

1. **[Getting started](getting_started.md)**: exaplin how to install ICEpy4D that will used for the processing.

2. **[Data preparation](getting_started.md)**: explains how to download the data and how to organize it for the processing.

3. **[Feature matching](matching.ipynb)**: explain how to perform a feature matching between two images by using Deep Learning algorithms, that are necessary for wide baseline stereo reconstruction.

4. **[Single epoch stereo riconstruction](single_epoch_stereo_reconstruction.ipynb)**: explain how to perform a stereo reconstruction from a stereo pair of images acquired in a single epoch.


## Software

We will use ICEpy4D Python toolkit for the stereo processing.
ICEpy4D is an open-source project for multitemporal photogrammetry developed by the Geodesy Geomatics Laboratory of Politecnico di Milano.
